Here are notes on some stuff I think was useful to me.

Chap 2 - Intervals

  Intervals above an octave are 7 + the interval with the octave

  Augmented 4th and dimished 5th are the same note, the tritone, or 3 whole steps.

Chap 3 - Scales

  Major - W W H W W W H
  Natural Minor - W H W W H W W
  A relative minor is the natural minor which uses the major scale's notes, but start a
    minor third below the major scale.
  Harmonic Minor - W H W W H W+H H
  Melodic Minor - W H W W W W H
  Melodic minor is only used when going up in some cases, and natural minor going down.

  Modes are effectively different starting points in the major scale, though that is not
    the best way to think about it when trying to actually play in a mode.
  Ionian mode is the major scale.
  Aeolian mode is the natural minor scale.

Chapter 8 - Melodies

  Melody is a logical progression of tones and rhythms.
  Melody is the most memorable part of a piece of music.

  Melody is often set up in 4/8/16 bar units.
  Melody pitch often repeats with slight changes, often feeling some tension before
    the repetition and more resolved at the end. Ending a repetition on the fifth
    of the scale can lead to a bit of tension.
  Melody rhythms often repeat as well, often at a different pace than the melody.
  Melody pitch often moves in direction (up or down) for a period.
  Simple rhythms and pitches can work well. Just pick the right ones.

  Base the melody on a specific scale.
  Fill in the blanks in a melody with passing tones (notes in between a starting
    tone and ending tone).
  Decorate melody with neighboring tones (move from a starting tone up or down a step,
    and then back to the original tone).

  Methods to make a Memorable Melody
  Center on a pitch - start and end there. doesn't have to be the root, but probably
    1, 3, or 5.
  Make sure you end up at home - (resolve the tension with expectation)
  Stay within the scale
  Use the pentatonic of the scale
  Find the hook - a short motif that grabs the listener
  Create variations - inversion and retrograde! - simplify and complicate
  Write in 4/8/16
  Make it move - give the pitches a contour
  Take small steps - each note only a step or two from the previous
  Stay in range - an octave to an octave and a third
  Avoid unsingable intervals - fourths, sixths and sevenths are problematic - octave ok
  Keep the rhythm simple - quarter notes and half notes, avoid 16th notes, avoid synchopation
  Stay in time - don't force a melody into a time signature
  Set up (and resolve) tension - end a first rep with the IV or V, then the 2nd with the I
  Set up a call and response
  Establish symmetry
  Balance repetition and variety
  Follow the chord progressions
  Follow the form
  Follow the words
  Write for a specific instrument or voice
  Be unique
  Learn more about composing

  The real test of a melody is in the singing.

Chapter 9 - Chords

  triads
  major chord = a root, a major third, and a perfect fifth
  minor chord = a root, a minor third, and a perfect fifth
  diminished chord = a minor chord with a flatted fifth
  augmented chord = a major chord with a sharpened fifth

  sevenths
  (dominant) seventh = major triad with a minor seventh
  major seventh = major triad with a major seventh
  minor seventh = minor triad with a minor seventh

  other extensions
  (added) sixth = add a sixth to a triad, can be major or minor
  ninth = added third above the seventh note in a seventh chord
  elevenths = added third above the ninth
  altered chord = take stated chord and change it according to parentheses
  suspended chord = change the third of a triad to a fourth or second
  power chord = just the root and fifth are used

  inversion
  when you play a chord with a note other than the root as the bass note

  chords can be added to music by simply writing the name of the chord over the staff
  chord rhythm patterns can be specified in slash notation

Chapter 10 - Chord Progressions

  Staying within a scale for forming triads at each scale degree creates a specific
    chord type at for each chord.

  Major - I     ii     iii    IV     V      vi     viidim
  Minor - i     iidim  III    iv     v      VI     VII
    the relative minor is also the progression of the vi chord in the major scale

  The I, IV, and V (tonic, subdominant, and dominant) carry the most weight.

  Gnerally, the purpose of the chord progression is to get back home to the tonic.

  Certain chords lead to others, and this chart can be used to make progressions.
    I      any
    ii     IV, V, viidim
    iii    ii, IV, vi
    IV     I, iii, V, viidim
    V      I
    vi     ii, IV, V, I
    viidim I, iii

  The ending of a musical phrase is often marked by a cadence, the use of chords to set
    up tension and then resolution.
    perfect cadence -- V-I
    plagal cadence -- IV-I
    imperfect cadence -- I-V, ii-V, IV-V, vi-V
    interrupted cadence -- V-IV, V-vi, V-ii, V-V7

  Common Chord Progressions
    I-IV
    I-V
    I-IV-V or I-IV-V7
    I-IV-V-IV
    I-V-vi-IV
    I-ii-IV-V
    I-ii-IV
    I-vi-ii-V
    I-vi-iV-V
    I-vi-ii-V7-ii
    IV-I-IV-V - also used as a jazz turnarond
    ii-V-I or ii7-V7-I7
    I-IV-viidim-iii-vi-ii-V-I - in-scale circle of fifths progression
    C-C7-F-F7-...-G-G7-C - actual circle of fifths
    I-I-I-I-IV-IV-I-I-V7-V7-I-I - a 12-bar blues pattern

  Chords and Melodies

    Melody first
      Usually you can find a common chord progression that fits the melody.
      Figuring out the timing of the progression might be challenging.
      Sometimes minor variations are also necessary.
      Tips --
        Go common first. I-IV-V fits so many things.
        The main notes of the melody (usually the first and third beat) should be a note
          from the underlying triad of the implied chord progressions.
        Simplify the melody when looking for the chord progression.
        Make sure you're in the right key. "Home" of the melody is probably the tonic.
        Generally, the slower the tempo, the more chord changes.
        Work backward from the end, and find the cadence to get there.
        Usually new chords are introduced at the first and third beat.

    Chords first
      Play the progression many times to get the feel before writing the melody.
        A melody may naturally come, and then you just have to figure out the notes.
      Tips for more prescribed approach --
        Stay within the notes of the chords.
        Try to find a logcal line between the main notes in different measures.
        Use notes that emphasize the quality of the underlying chords.
        Once you pick main tones, fill in the gaps with passing tones.
          passing tone - note of an upcoming chord played early
        Come up with an interesting rhythmic motif, and repeat it through the melody.

Chapter 11 - Phrases and Forms

  Song form - the form the parts of the song create

  Parts of a Song
    Introduction - typically an instrumental lead in
      - any length, or no length
      - may include a main theme or chord progression
      - used to set up the first verse

    Verse - first main melody of a piece, often repeated
      - if lyrics, repeats are typcially different
      - probably end on a tonic (I) for resolution or dominant (V) for tension
      - lyrics should relate to the chorus

    Chorus - second main melody of a song
      - emotional high point
      - should contain the hook (melody, chords, rhythm, or lyric) if there is one
      - often shorter than verses, and just four to eight measures

    Bridge - a musical break in the middle of a piece
      - sounds different than the verse or chorus
      - typically short - eight measures

    Instrument Solo - instrumental section for a lyrical break and/or an instrumental spotlight

    Ending - brings the song musically to a close
      - can stop the last chorus on a tonic (I)
      - can be a unique ending section with a cadence or turnaraound
      - can mirror the intro, or reflect the melodic or harmonic nature of the piece
      - can be a faded out chorus, also

  Putting It All Together

    - Pop and jazz is based on eight-mesure phrases, but can be 16 or 32 (divisible by 8)
    - labeling a verse as A, a chorus as B, and a bridge as C, it becomes easy to look at form

      A  B  A  B
      A  A  B  A
      A  A  B  C  B
      A  A  B  A  C  A  B
      A1 A2 A3 A4 etc  - typical of folk with no choruses

  Head Cases

    head arrangement - form suited for extended improvisation
      - play a melody section straightforward, then solo over the chords, then straight again

      A(head)    A(solos)   A(head repeat)
      ABA(head)  ABA(solos) ABA(head repeat)

  Classical Musical Forms

    There are an extensive number of these.
